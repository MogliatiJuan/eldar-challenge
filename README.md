# ELDAR FrontEnd Semi-Senior Challenge

This repository contains a user login application developed as part of the ELDAR FrontEnd Semi-Senior challenge. The aim of this challenge is to implement a robust login system, showcasing proficiency in modern frontend development practices such as state management, routing, API integration and validaitions.

## Challenge Description

The objective of this challenge is to develop a web application with advanced authentication, role management, and an architecture optimized for scalable projects. The "user" role will have read-only access to data fetched from an API, while the "admin" role will be able to create and edit data.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Implements a login form with validation to authenticate users against an API
- **Protected Routes**: Certain routes are protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users
- **API Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with a fake backend API for authentication and fetching data
- **Form Validation**: Ensures proper user input handling with client-side validation.
- **Error Handling**: Displays informative error messages to the user in case of invalid credentials or page navigation errors (e.g., 404 Not Found)

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
    git clone https://github.com/MogliatiJuan/eldar-challenge.git
    cd eldar-challenge
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
    npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```
    npm run dev
   ```
    #### The app will be accessible at http://localhost:5173

4. **Build for production**:
   ```
    npm run build
   ```
    This command will create a production-ready build of the app.

5. **Preview the production build**:
   ```
    npm run preview
   ```
    #### The app will be accessible at http://localhost:4173

## Credentials for Testing

You can use the following credentials to test the login functionality:

- ADMIN:
  - **Username**: admin
  - **Password**: admin123
- USER:
  - **Username**: user
  - **Password**: user1234

These credentials are part of the fake-backend API used for development purposes.


## Tech Stack

- **React 18**: For building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For client-side routing and managing protected routes.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and reduces runtime errors.
- **Vite**: Fast bundling and development server with SWC.
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management for handling user session and global state.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to a fake-backend API.
- **Material UI**: For providing modern and responsive UI components.

## Deployment
The app is deployed on Vercel. You can view the live version [here](https://eldar-challenge-rl9vgpmqo-mogliatijuans-projects.vercel.app).
